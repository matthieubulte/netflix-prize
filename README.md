# Netflix Prize Data

Toying around with the Netflix Prize Dataset.

### Getting the data
You can download the data used in this project from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data/version/1). You should then extract the content of the zipped dataset in the `./dataset` directory.

### Installing
I used [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage my dependencies in this project. To re-create my environment, simply run `conda env create -n netflix -f environment.yml` and activate it using `conda activate netflix`.
